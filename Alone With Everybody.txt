The flesh covers the bone
and they put a mind in there
and sometimes a soul,
and the women break vases
against the walls
and the men drink too much
and nobody finds the one
but keep looking
crawling in and out of beds.


Flesh covers the bone
and the flesh searches
for more than flesh.


There's no chance at all:
We are all trapped by
a singular fate.


Nobody ever finds the one.


The city dumps fill,
the junkyards fill,
the madhouses fill,
the hospitals fill,
the graveyards fill...


Nothing else fills.
