from my bed
I watch
3 birds
on a telephone   
wire.


one flies
off.
then   
another.


one is left,
then
it too
is gone.


my typewriter is
tombstone
still.


and I am
reduced to bird
watching.


just thought I'd
let you
know,
fucker.


With an Apple Macintosh
you can't run Radio Shack programs
in its disc drive.
Nor can a Commodore 64 drive
read a file you have created
on an IBM Personal Computer.


Both Kaypro and Osborne computers use
the CP/M operating system
but can't read each other's handwriting
for they format (write on)
discs in different ways.
The Tandy 2000 runs MS-DOS but
can't use most programs produced for
the IBM Personal Computer
unless certain bits and bytes
are altered.


But the wind still blows
over Savannah,
and in the Spring
the turkey buzzard
struts and flounces
before his hens.


At the track today,
Father's Day,
each paid admission was
entitled to a wallet
and each contained a
little surprise.


Most of the men seemed
between 30 and 55,
going to fat,
many of them in walking
shorts,
they had gone stale in
life,
flattened out....


In fact, damn it, they
aren't even worth writing
about!
Why am I doing
this?
These don't even
deserve a death bed,
these little walking
whales,
only there are so
many of
them,
in the urinals,
in the food lines,
they have managed to
survive
in a most limited
sense
but when you see
so many of them
like that,
there and not there,
breathing, farting,
commenting,
waiting for a thunder
that will not arrive,
waiting for the charging
white horse of Glory,
waiting for the lovely
female that is not
there,
waiting to win,
waiting for the great
dream to
engulf them
but they do nothing,
they clomp in their
sandals,
gnaw at hot dogs
dog style,
gulping at the
meat,
they complain about
losing,
blame the jocks,
drink green
beer,
the parking lot is
jammed with their
unpaid for
cars,
the jocks mount
again for another
race,
the men press
toward the betting
windows mesmerized,
fathers and non-fathers,
Monday is waiting
for them,
this is the last
big lark.


And the horses are
totally
beautiful.
it is shocking how
beautiful they
are
at that time,
at that place,
their life shines
through;
miracles happen,
even in
hell.


I decide to stay for
one more
race.


don’t ever get the idea I am a poet; you can see me
at the racetrack any day half drunk
betting quarters, sidewheelers and straight thoroughs,
but let me tell you, there are some women there
who go where the money goes, and sometimes when you
look at these whores these onehundreddollar whores
you wonder sometimes if nature isn’t playing a joke
dealing out so much breast and ass and the way
it’s all hung together, you look and you look and
you look and you can’t believe it; there are ordinary women
and then there is something else that wants to make you
tear up paintings and break albums of Beethoven
across the back of the john; anyhow, the season
was dragging and the big boys were getting busted,
all the non-pros, the producers, the cameraman,
the pushers of Mary, the fur salesman, the owners
themselves, and Saint Louie was running this day:
a sidewheeler that broke when he got in close;
he ran with his head down and was mean and ugly
and 35 to 1, and I put a ten down on him.
the driver broke him wide
took him out by the fence where he’d be alone
even if he had to travel four times as far,
and that’s the way he went it
all the way by the outer fence
traveling two miles in one
and he won like he was mad as hell
and he wasn’t even tired,
and the biggest blonde of all
all ass and breast, hardly anything else
went to the payoff window with me.


that night I couldn’t destroy her
although the springs shot sparks
and they pounded on the walls.
later she sat there in her slip
drinking Old Grandad
and she said
what’s a guy like you doing
living in a dump like this?
and I said
I’m a poet


and she threw back her beautiful head and laughed.


you? you . . . a poet?


I guess you’re right, I said, I guess you’re right.


but still she looked good to me, she still looked good,
and all thanks to an ugly horse
who wrote this poem.


Shot in the eye
shot in the brain
shot in the ass
shot like a flower in the dance
amazing how death wins hands down
amazing how much credence is given to idiot forms of life
amazing how laughter has been drowned out
amazing how viciousness is such a constant


I must soon declare my own war on their war
I must hold to my last piece of ground
I must protect the small space I have made that has allowed me life
my life not their death
my death not their death…


The phone rang at 1:30 a.m.
and it was a man from Denver:


"Chinaski, you got a following in
Denver..."
"yeah?"
"yeah, I got a magazine and I want some
poems from you..."
"FUCK YOU, CHINASKI!" I heard a voice
in the background...
"I see you have a friend,"
I said.
"yeah," he answered, "now, I want
six poems..."
"CHINASKI SUCKS! CHINASKI'S A PRICK!"
I heard the other
voice.
"you fellows been drinking?"
I asked.
"so what?" he answered. "you drink."
"that's true..."
"CHINASKI'S AN ASSHOLE!"


Then
the editor of the magazine gave me the
address and I copied it down on the back
of an envelope.
"send us some poems now..."
"I'll see what I can do..."
"CHINASKI WRITES SHIT!"
"goodbye," I said.
"goodbye," said the
editor.
I hung up.
there are certainly any number of lonely
people without much to do with
their nights.


George was lying in his trailer,
flat on his back,
watching a small portable T.V.
His dinner dishes were undone,
his breakfast dishes were undone,
he needed a shave,
and ash from his rolled cigarettes
dropped onto his undershirt.


Some of the ash was still burning.
Sometimes the burning ash missed the undershirt
and hit his skin,
then he cursed, brushing it away.


There was a knock on the trailer door.
He got slowly to his feet
and answered the door.
It was Constance.


She had a fifth of unopened whiskey in a bag.
"George, I left that son of a bitch,
I couldn't stand that son of a bitch anymore."
"Sit down."
George opened the fifth, got two glasses,
filled each a third with whiskey, two thirds
with water.
He sat down on the bed with Constance.
She took a cigarette out of her purse
and lit it.
She was drunk and her hands trembled.
"I took his damn money too. I took his damn money
and split while he was at work.
You don't know how I've suffered with that son of a bitch."


"Lemme have a smoke," said George.
She handed it to him and as she leaned near,
George put his arm around her, pulled her over and kissed her.
"You son of a bitch," she said, "I missed you."
"I miss those good legs of yours , Connie.
I've really missed those good legs."
"You still like 'em?"
"I get hot just looking."
"I could never make it with a college guy," said Connie.
"They're too soft, they're milk-toast.
And he kept his house clean.
George, it was like having a maid.
He did it all. The place was spotless.
You could eat beef stew right off the crapper.
He was antiseptic, that's what he was."


"Drink up, you'll feel better."
"And he couldn't make love."
"You mean he couldn't get it up?"
"Oh he got it up, he got it up all the time.
But he didn't know how to make a woman happy,
you know. He didn't know what to do. All that money,
all that education, he was useless."
"I wish I had a college education."
"You don't need one. You have everything you need, George."
"I'm just a flunky. All the shit jobs."
"I said you have everything you need, George.
You know how to make a woman happy."
"Yeh?"
"Yes. And you know what else? His mother came around!
His mother! Two or three times a week.
And she'd sit there looking at me,
pretending to like me but all the time
she was treating me like I was a whore.
Like I was a big bad whore stealing her son away
from her! Her precious Wallace! Christ! What a mess!"


"He claimed he loved me.
And I'd say, 'Look at my pussy, Walter!'
And he wouldn't look at my pussy.
He said, 'I don't want to look at that thing.'
That thing! That's what he called it! You're not afraid
of my pussy, are you, George?"
"It's never bit me yet."
"But you've bit it, you've nibbled it, haven't
you George?"
"I suppose I have."
"And you've licked it, sucked it?"
"I suppose so."
"You know damn well, George, what you've done."


"How much money did you get?"
"Six hundred dollars."
"I don't like people who rob other people, Connie."
"That's why you're a fucking dishwasher.
You're honest.
But he's such an ass, George. And he can afford the money,
and I've earned it... him and his mother and his
love, his mother-love, his clean little wash bowls
and toilets and disposal bags and
breath chasers and after shave lotions
and his little hard-ons and his precious
love-making. All for himself, you understand, all for himself!
You know what a woman wants, George."


"Thanks for the whiskey, Connie. Lemme have another cigarette."
George filled them up again. "I missed your legs, Connie.
I've really missed those legs.
I like the way you wear those high heels.
They drive me crazy. These modern women
don't know what they're missing.
The high heel shapes the calf,
the thigh, the ass;
It puts rhythm into the walk.
It really turns me on!"


"You talk like a poet, George.
Sometimes you talk like that.
You are one hell of a dishwasher."
"You know what I'd really like to do?"
"What?"
"I'd like to whip you with my belt on the legs,
the ass, the thighs. I'd like to
make you quiver and cry and then when you're quivering
and crying I'd slam it into you pure love."
"I don't want that, George.
You've never talked like that to me before. You've
always done right with me."
"Pull your dress up higher."
"What?"
"Pull your dress up higher, I want to see more of your legs."
"You like my legs, don't you, George?"
"Let the light shine on them!"
Constance hiked her dress.
"God Christ shit," said George.
"You like my legs?"
"I love your legs!"


Then George reached across the bed and slapped Constance
hard across the face. Her cigarette flipped out of her mouth.
"What'd you do that for?"
"You fucked Walter! You fucked Walter!"
"So what the hell?"
"So pull your dress up higher!"
"No!"
"Do what I say!" George slapped again, harder.
Constance hiked her skirt.
"Just up to the panties!" shouted George.
"I don't quite want to see the panties!"
"Christ, George, what's gone wrong with you?"
"You fucked Walter!"
"George, I swear, you've gone crazy.
I want to leave. Let me out of here, George!"
"Don't move or I'll kill you!"
"You'd kill me?"
"I swear it!" George got up
and poured himself a shot of straight whiskey,
drank it, and sat down next to Constance.
He took the cigarette and held it against her wrist.
She screamed. He held it there, firmly, then pulled it away.
"I'm a man, baby, understand that?"
"I know you're a man, George."
"Here, look at my muscles!" George sat up
and flexed both of his arms.
"Beautiful, eh ,baby? Look at that muscle!
Feel it! Feel it!"
Constance felt one of the arms, then the other.
"Yes, you have a beautiful body, George."
"I'm a man. I'm a dishwasher but I'm a man, a real man."
"I know it, George." "I'm not the milks-hit you left."
"I know it."
"And I can sing, too. You ought to hear my voice."
Constance sat there. George began to sing.
He sang "Old man River."
Then he sang "Nobody knows the trouble I've seen."
He sang "The St. Louis Blues."
He sang "God Bless America," stopping several times and laughing.


Then he sat down next to Constance.
He said, "Connie, you have beautiful legs."
He asked for another cigarette.
He smoked it, drank two more drinks, then put his head
down on Connie's legs, against the stockings,
in her lap, and he said, "Connie, I guess I'm no good,
I guess I'm crazy, I'm sorry I hit you,
I'm sorry I burned you with that cigarette."


Constance sat there. She ran her fingers
through George's hair, stroking him,
soothing him.
Soon he was asleep.
She waited a while longer.
Then she lifted his head and placed it
on the pillow, lifted his legs
and straightened them out on the bed.
She stood up, walked to the fifth,
poured a jolt of good whiskey in to her glass,
added a touch of water and drank it sown.
She walked to the trailer door,
pulled it open, stepped out, closed it.
She walked through the backyard,
opened the fence gate, walked up the alley
under the one o'clock moon.


The sky was clear of clouds.
The same skyful of clouds was up there.
She got out on the boulevard and walked east
and reached the entrance of The Blue Mirror.
She walked in, and there was Walter sitting alone
and drunk at the end of the bar. She walked
up and sat down next to him. "Missed me, baby?" she asked.
Walter looked up. He recognized her. He didn't answer.
He looked at the bartender and the bartender walked
toward them.
They all knew each other.


It was on the 2nd floor on Coronado Street
I used to get drunk
and throw the radio through the window
while it was playing, and, of course,
it would break the glass in the window
and the radio would sit there on the roof
still playing
and I'd tell my woman,
"Ah, what a marvelous radio!".


The next morning I'd take the window
off the hinges
and carry it down the street
to the glass man
who would put in another pane.


I kept throwing that radio through the window
each time I got drunk
and it would sit there on the roof
still playing-
a magic radio
a radio with guts,
and each morning I'd take the window
back to the glass man.


I don't remember how it ended exactly
though I do remember
we finally moved out.


There was a woman downstairs who worked in
the garden in her bathing suit,
she really dug with that trowel
and she put her behind up in the air
and I used to sit in the window
and watch the sun shine all over that thing
while the music played.


We had goldfish
and they circled
around and around
in the bowl
on the table
near the heavy drapes
covering the picture window
and my mother,
always smiling,
wanting us all
to be happy,
told me, "be happy Henry!"


And she was right:
it's better to be happy
if you can,
but my father
continued to beat her
and me several times a week
while raging inside his 6-foot-two frame
because he couldn't
understand what was attacking
him from within.


My mother, poor fish,
wanting to be happy,
beaten two or three times a
week, telling me to be happy:
"Henry, smile!
Why don't you ever smile?"
and then she would smile,
to show me how, and it was the
saddest smile I ever saw
one day the goldfish died,
all five of them,
they floated on the water,
on their sides, their
eyes still open,
and when my father got home
he threw them to the cat
there on the kitchen floor
and we watched
as my mother smiled


He lives in a house with a swimming pool
and says the job is killing him.
He is 27. I am 44.
I can't seem to get rid of him.
His novels keep coming back.
"what do you expect me to do?" he screams
"go to New York and pump the hands of the
publishers?"
"no," I tell him, "but quit your job, go into a
small room and do the thing."
"but I need assurance, I need something to
go by, some word, some sign!"
"some men did not think that way:
Van Gogh, Wagner-"
"oh hell, Van Gogh had a brother who gave him
paints whenever he needed them!"


"Look," he said,
"I'm over at this broad's house today and
this guy walks in. A salesman. You know
how they talk. Drove up in this new car.
Talked about his vacation.
Said he went to Frisco - saw Fidelio
up there but forgot who wrote it.
Now this guy is 54 years old. So I told him:
'Fidelio is Beethoven's only opera.'
And then I told him: 'you're a jerk!'
'whatcha mean?' he asked.
'I mean, you're a jerk, you're 54 years old and
you don't know anything!'"
"what happened then?"
"I walked out."
"You mean you left him there with her?"
"Yes."
"I can't quit my job," he said.
"I always have trouble getting a
job. I walk in, they look at me,
listen to me talk and they think right away, ah ha!
He's too intelligent for this job,
he won't stay so there's really no sense
in hiring him.


Now, you walk into a place and you
don't have any trouble:
you look like an old wino,
you look like a guy who needs a
job and they look at you and they think:
ah ha! now here's a guy who really needs work!
If we hire him he'll stay a long time
and work hard!"
"Do any of those people," he asks "know you are a
writer, that you write poetry?"
"No."
"You never talk about it. Not even to me!
if I hadn't seen you in that magazine I'd
have never known."
"That's right."
"Still, I'd like to tell these people
that you are a writer."
"I'd still like to
tell them."
"Why?"
"Well, they talk about you. They think
you are just a horse-player and a drunk."
"I am both of those."
"Well, they talk about you. You have odd ways.
You travel alone.
I'm the only friend you have."
"Yes."
"They talk you down. I'd like to defend you.
I'd like to tell them you write poetry."
"Leave it alone. I work here like they do.
We're all the same."
"Well, I'd like to do it for myself then.
I want them to know why I travel with you.
I speak 7 languages, I know my music"
"Forget it."
"All right, I'll respect your wishes. But there's
something else"
"What?"
"I've been thinking about getting a piano.
But then I've been thinking about getting a
violin too but I can't make up my mind!"
"Buy a piano."
"You think so?"
"Yes."


He walks away thinking about it.
I was thinking about it
too: I figure he can always come over with his
violin and more sad music.




I pick up the skirt,
I pick up the sparkling beads
in black,
this thing that moved once
around flesh,
and I call God a liar,
I say anything that moved
like that
or knew
my name
could never die
in the common verity of dying,
and I pick
up her lovely dress,
all her loveliness gone,
and I speak to all the gods,
Jewish gods, Christ-gods,
chips of blinking things,
idols, pills, bread,
fathoms, risks,
knowledgeable surrender,
rats in the gravy of 2 gone quite mad
without a chance,
hummingbird knowledge, hummingbird chance,
I lean upon this,
I lean on all of this
and I know:
her dress upon my arm:
but they will not
give her back to me.


The flesh covers the bone
and they put a mind in there
and sometimes a soul,
and the women break vases
against the walls
and the men drink too much
and nobody finds the one
but keep looking
crawling in and out of beds.


Flesh covers the bone
and the flesh searches
for more than flesh.


There's no chance at all:
We are all trapped by
a singular fate.


Nobody ever finds the one.


The city dumps fill,
the junkyards fill,
the madhouses fill,
the hospitals fill,
the graveyards fill...


Nothing else fills.


I see you drinking
at a fountain
with tiny blue hands,
no, your hands are not tiny
they are small,
and the fountain is in France
where you wrote me that last letter and
I answered
and never heard from you again.


You used to write insane poems
about ANGELS AND GOD,
all in upper case,
and you knew famous artists
and most of them were your lovers,
and I wrote back,
it’ all right,
go ahead,
enter their lives,
I’ not jealous because we’ never met.


We got close once in New Orleans,
one half block,
but never met,
never touched.


So you went with the famous
and wrote about the famous,
and, of course, what you found out
is that the famous are worried
about their fame –– not the beautiful
young girl in bed with them,
who gives them that,
and then awakens in the morning
to write upper case poems
about ANGELS AND GOD.


We know God is dead,
they’ told us,
but listening to you
I wasn’ sure.


Maybe it was the upper case.
You were one of the best female poets
and I told the publishers and editors:
“Her, print her, she’ mad but she’ magic.
There’ no lie in her fire.”


I loved you like a man loves a woman
he never touches,
only writes to,
keeps little photographs of.


I would have loved you more
if I had sat in a small room
rolling a cigarette and listened to you
piss in the bathroom,
but that didn’ happen.


Your letters got sadder.
Your lovers betrayed you.
Kid, I wrote back, all lovers betray.
It didn’ help.


You said you had a crying bench
and it was by a bridge
and the bridge was over a river
and you sat on the crying bench
every night
and wept for the lovers
who had hurt and forgotten you.


I wrote back but never heard again.
A friend wrote me of your suicide
3 or 4 months after it happened.


If I had met you
I would probably have been unfair to you
or you to me.


It was best like this.


Having the low down blues and going
into a restaurant to eat.
You sit at a table.
The waitress smiles at you.
She's dumpy. Her ass is too big.
She radiates kindness and sympathy.
Live with her 3 months and a man
would know real agony.
O.k., you'll tip her 15 percent.
You order a turkey sandwich and a beer.
The man at the table across from you
has watery blue eyes and
a head like an elephant.
At a table further down are 3 men
with very tiny heads
and long necks
like ostriches.
They talk loudly of land development.
Why, you think, did I ever come
in here when I have the low-down
blues?
Then the the waitress comes back with the sandwich
and she asks you if there will be anything
else?
So you tell her, no no, this will be fine.
Then somebody behind you laughs.
It's a cork laugh filled with sand and
broken glass.
You begin eating the sandwich.
It's something.
It's a minor, difficult,
sensible action
like composing a popular song
to make a 14-year old
weep.
You order another beer.
Jesus, look at that guy
his hands hang down almost to his knees
and he's whistling.
Well, time to get out.
Pick up the bill.
Tip.
Go to the register.
Pay.
Pick up a toothpick.
Go out the door.
Your car is still there.
And there are 3 men with heads
and necks
like ostriches all getting into one car.
They each have a toothpick and now,
they are talking about women.
They drive away first
they drive away fast.
They're best I guess.
It's an unbearably hot day.
There's a first-stage smog alert.
All the birds and plants are dead
or dying.
You start the engine.


Washed-up, on shore,
the old yellow notebook
out again.
I write from the bed
as I did last year.
Will see the doctor on Monday.
"Yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo,
head-aches and my back hurts."
"Are you drinking?" he will ask.
"Are you getting your exercise,
your vitamins?"
I think that I am just ill
with life, the same stale yet
fluctuating factors.
Even at the track
I watch the horses run by
and it seems meaningless.
I leave early after buying tickets on the
remaining races.
"Taking off?" asks the motel clerk.
"Yes, it's boring,"
I tell him.
"If you think it's boring out there,"
he tells me, "you oughta be back here."


So here I am
propped up against my pillows
again
just an old guy
just an old writer
with a yellow notebook.
Something is
walking across the floor
toward me.
Oh, it's just my cat
this time.


As the poems go into the thousands
you realize that you've created very little.


It comes down to the rain, the sunlight,
the traffic, the nights and the days
of the years, the faces.


Leaving this will be easier than living it,
typing one more line now as a man plays a piano
through the radio,
the best writers have said very little
and the worst, far too much.


To give life you must take life,
and as our grief falls flat and hollow
upon the billion-blooded sea
I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed
with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures
lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.


Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow
did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be
young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.
I hated you when it would have taken
less courage to love.


I awaken about noon
and go out to get the mail
in my old torn bathrobe.
I'm hung over
hair down in my eyes
barefoot
gingerly walking
on the small sharp rocks in my path
still afraid of pain behind my four-day beard.


The young housewife next door shakes a rug
out of her window and sees me:
"Hello, Hank!"
God damn! It's almost like being shot in the ass
with a .22


"Hello," I say
gathering up my Visa card bill, my Penny saver coupons,
a Dept. of Water and Power past-due notice,
a letter from the mortgage people
plus a demand from the Weed Abatement Department
giving me 30 days to clean up my act.


I mince back again over the small sharp rocks
thinking, maybe I'd better write something tonight,
they all seem to be closing in.
There's only one way to handle those motherfuckers.
The night harness races will have to wait.


We are always asked
to understand
the other person's viewpoint
no matter how out-dated
foolish or obnoxious.
One is asked
to view
their total error
their life-waste
with kindliness,
especially if they are aged.
But age is the total of
our doing.
They have aged badly
because they have lived
out of focus,
they have refused to see.
Not their fault?
Whose fault?
Mine?
I am asked to hide
my viewpoint from them
for fear of their fear.
Age is no crime
but the shame
of a deliberately wasted life
among so many
deliberately wasted lives
is.

Drunk on the dark streets of some city,
it's night, you're lost, where's your
room?
You enter a bar to find yourself,
order scotch and water.
damned bar's sloppy wet, it soaks
part of one of your shirt
sleeves.
It's a clip joint-the scotch is weak.
you order a bottle of beer.
Madame Death walks up to you
wearing a dress.
She sits down, you buy her a
beer, she stinks of swamps, presses
a leg against you.
The bar tender sneers.
you've got him worried, he doesn't
know if you're a cop, a killer, a
madman or an Idiot.
You ask for a vodka.
You pour the vodka into the top of
the beer bottle.
It's one a.m. In a dead cow world.
You ask her how much for head,
drink everything down, it tastes
like machine oil.
You leave Madame Death there,
you leave the sneering bartender
there.
You have remembered where
your room is.
The room with the full bottle of
wine on the dresser.
The room with the dance of the
roaches.
Perfection in the Star Turd
where love died laughing.


There's a bluebird in my heart
that wants to get out
but I'm too tough for him,
I say, stay in there,
I'm not going to let anybody see you.


There's a bluebird in my heart
that wants to get out
but I pour whiskey on him
and inhale cigarette smoke
and the whores
and the bartenders
and the grocery clerks
never know that he's in there.


There's a bluebird in my heart
that wants to get out
but I'm too tough for him,
I say, stay down,
do you want to mess me up?
You want to screw up the works?
You want to blow my book sales in Europe?


There's a bluebird in my heart
that wants to get out
but I'm too clever,
I only let him out at night sometimes
when everybody's asleep.


I say, I know that you're there,
so don't be sad.
Then I put him back,
but he's singing a little in there,
I haven't quite let him die
and we sleep together like that
with our secret pact
and it's nice enough
to make a man weep,
but I don't weep...


Do you?


She died of alcoholism
wrapped in a blanket
on a deck chair
on an ocean
steamer.


All her books of
terrified loneliness,
all her books about
the cruelty
of loveless love
were all
that was left of her.


As the strolling vacationer
discovered her body
notified the captain
and she was quickly dispatched
to somewhere else
on the ship
as everything continued
just as
she had written it.


The best often die by their own hand
just to get away,
and those left behind
can never quite understand
why anybody
would ever want to
get away
from them.


At one stage in my life
I met a man who claimed to have
visited Pound at St. Elizabeth's.
Then I met a woman who not only
claimed to have visited E.P.
but also to have made love
to him. She even showed me
certain sections in the Cantos
where Ezra was supposed to have
mentioned her.


So there was this man
and this woman,
and the woman told me
that Pound had never
mentioned a visit from this man,
and the man claimed that the
lady had had nothing to do
with the master,
that she was a charlatan
and since I wasn't a
Poundian scholar
I didn't know who to believe,
but one thing I do 
know: when a man is living
many claim relationships
that are hardly so
and after he dies, well,
then it's everybody's party.


My guess is that Pound
knew neither the lady
or the gentleman
or if he knew one
or if he knew both
it was a shameful waste
of madhouse time.


Waiting for death
like a cat
that will jump on the bed
I am so very sorry for
my wife.
She will see
this stiff white body
shake it once,
then maybe again...


"Hank!"


Hank won't answer.


It's not my death that
worries me, it's my wife
left with this
pile of nothing.


I want to
let her know though
that all the nights
sleeping beside her
even the useless arguments
were things ever splendid,
and the hard words
I ever feared to say
can now be said:
I love you.


I even hear the mountains
the way they laugh
up and down their blue sides
and down in the water
the fish cry
and the water
is their tears.
I listen to the water
on nights I drink away
and the sadness becomes so great
I hear it in my clock
it becomes knobs upon my dresser
it becomes paper on the floor
it becomes a shoehorn
a laundry ticket
it becomes
cigarette smoke
climbing a chapel of dark vines...
it matters little
very little love is not so bad
or very little life
what counts
is waiting on walls
I was born for this
I was born to hustle roses down the avenues of the dead.


Good weather
is like good women-
it doesn't always happen
and when it does
it doesn't
always last.


Man is more stable:
if he's bad
there's more chance
he'll stay that way,
or if he's good
he might hang on,
but a woman is changed
by children,
age,
diet,
conversation,
sex,
the moon,
the absence or
presence of sun
or good times.
A woman must be nursed
into subsistence
by love
where a man can become
stronger by being hated.
I am drinking tonight in Spangler's Bar
and I remember the cows
I once painted in Art class
and they looked good,
they looked better than anything
in here.
I am drinking in Spangler's Bar
wondering which to love and which
to hate, but the rules are gone:
I love and hate only myself -
they stand outside me
like an orange dropped from the table
and rolling away;
It's what I've got to decide:
kill myself or
love myself?
Which is the treason?
Where's the information
coming from?
Books... like broken glass:
I wouldn't wipe my ass with 'em
yet, it's getting darker, see?
(we drink here and speak to
each other and seem knowing).
Buy the cow with the biggest tits
buy the cow with the biggest rump.


The bartender slides me a beer,
it runs down the bar
like an Olympic sprinter
and the pair of pliers that is my hand
stops it, lifts it,
golden piss of dull temptation,
I drink and
stand there
the weather bad for cows
but my brush is ready
to stroke up
the green grass straw eye
sadness takes me all over
and I drink the beer straight down
order a shot fast
to give me the guts
and the love to go on.


Yes, they begin out in a willow, I think
the starch mountains begin out in the willow
and keep right on going without regard for
pumas and nectarines
somehow these mountains are like
an old woman with a bad memory and
a shopping basket.
We are in a basin. That is the idea.
Down in the sand and the alleys,
this land punched-in, cuffed-out, divided,
held like a crucifix in a death-hand,
this land bought, resold, bought again and
sold again, the wars long over,
the Spaniards all the way back in Spain
down in the thimble again, and now
real estaters, subdividers, landlords,
freeway engineers arguing.
This is their land and
I walk on it, live on it a little while
near Hollywood here I see young men in rooms
listening to glazed recordings
and I think too of old men sick of music
sick of everything, and death like suicide
I think is sometimes voluntary,
and to get your hold on the land here
it is best to return to the Grand Central Market,
see the old Mexican women,
the poor... I am sure you have seen
these same women many years before
arguing with the same young Japanese clerks
witty, knowledgeable and golden
among their soaring store of oranges, apples
avocados, tomatoes, cucumbers -
and you know how these look, they do look good
as if you could eat them all
light a cigar and smoke away the bad world.
Then it's best to go back to the bars,
the same bars wooden,
stale,
merciless,
green,
with the young policeman walking through
scared and looking for trouble,
and the beer is still bad
it has an edge that already mixes with vomit
and decay,
and you've got to be strong
in the shadows to ignore it,
to ignore the poor and to ignore yourself
and the shopping bag between your legs
down there feeling good with its avocados and
oranges and fresh fish and wine bottles, who needs
a Fort Lauderdale winter?


25 years ago there used to be a whore there
with a film over one eye, who was too fat
and made little silver bells out of cigarette
tinfoil. The sun seemed warmer then
although this was probably not
true, and you take your shopping bag
outside and walk along the street
and the green beer hangs there
just above your stomach
like a short and shameful shawl, and
you look around and no longer
see any old men.


The final curtain
on one of the longest running
musicals ever,
some people claim to have
seen it over one hundred times.
I saw it on the tv news,
that final curtain:
flowers, cheers, tears,
a thunderous accolade.


I have not seen this particular musical
but I know if I had that I wouldn't have
been able to bear it,
it would have sickened me.


Trust me on this, the world and its
peoples and its artful entertainment has
done very little for me, only to me.
Still, let them enjoy one another, it will
keep them from my door
and for this,
my own thunderous accolade.


It's never quite right,
he said, the way people look,
the way the music sounds,
the way the words are written.
It's never quite right, he said,
all the things we are taught,
all the loves we chase,
all the deaths we die,
all the lives we live,
they are never quite right,
they are hardly close to right,
these lives we live
one after the other,
piled there as history,
the waste of the species,
the crushing of the light and the way,
it's not quite right,
it's hardly right at all
he said.
Don't I know it? I answered.
I walked away from the mirror.
It was morning, it was afternoon,
it was night
nothing changed
it was locked in place.
Something flashed,
something broke,
something remained.
I walked down the stairway and
into it.


Death wants more death, and its webs are full:
I remember my father's garage, how child-like
I would brush the corpses of flies
from the windows they thought were escape-
their sticky, ugly, vibrant bodies
shouting like dumb crazy dogs against the glass
only to spin and flit
in that second larger than hell or heaven
onto the edge of the ledge,
and then the spider from his dank hole
nervous and exposed
the puff of body swelling
hanging there
not really quite knowing,
and then knowing-
something sending it down its string,
the wet web,
toward the weak shield of buzzing,
the pulsing;
a last desperate moving hair-leg
there against the glass
there alive in the sun,
spun in white;
and almost like love:
the closing over,
the first hushed spider-sucking:
filling its sack
upon this thing that lived;
crouching there upon its back
drawing its certain blood
as the world goes by outside
and my temples scream
and I hurl the broom against them:
the spider dull with spider-anger
still thinking of its prey
and waving an amazed broken leg;
the fly very still,
a dirty speck stranded to straw;
I shake the killer loose
and he walks lame and peeved
towards some dark corner
but I intercept his dawdling
his crawling like some broken hero,
and the straws smash his legs
now waving
above his head
and looking
looking for the enemy
and somewhat valiant,
dying without apparent pain
simply crawling backward
piece by piece
leaving nothing there
until at last the red gut sack
splashes
its secrets,
and I run child-like
with God's anger a step behind,
back to simple sunlight,
wondering
as the world goes by
with curled smile
if anyone else
saw or sensed my crime


Naked along the side of the house,
8 a.m.,
spreading sesame seed oil
over my body, Jesus,
have I come to this?
I once battled in dark alleys
for a laugh.
Now I'm not laughing.
I splash myself with oil and wonder,
how many years do you want?
How many days?
My blood is soiled and a dark
angel sits in my brain.
Things are made of something and
go to nothing.
I understand the fall of cities,
of nations.
A small plane passes overhead.
I look upward as if it made sense to
look upward.
It's true, the sky has rotted:
It won't be long for any of us.


I've come by, she says, to tell you
that this is it.
I'm not kidding, it's over. 
This is it.
I sit on the couch
watching her arrange
her long red hair
before my bedroom mirror.


She pulls her hair up and
piles it on top of her head -
she lets her eyes look at my eyes -
then she drops her hair and
lets it fall down in front of her face.


We go to bed and I hold her
speechlessly from the back
my arm around her neck
I touch her wrists and hands
feel up to her elbows no further.
She gets up.


This is it, she says, this will do.
Well, I'm going.
I get up and walk her to the door,
just as she leaves she says,
I want you to buy me
some high-heeled shoes
with tall thin spikes,
black high-heeled shoes.
No, I want them red.
I watch her walk down the cement walk
under the trees
she walks all right and
as the poinsettias drip in the sun


I close the door.


Some dogs who sleep at night
must dream of bones
and I remember your bones
in flesh and best
in that dark green dress
and those high-heeled bright
black shoes,
you always cursed when you drank,
your hair coming down you
wanted to explode out of
what was holding you:
rotten memories of a
rotten past, and
you finally got out
by dying,
leaving me with the
rotten present;


You've been dead
28 years
yet I remember you
better than any of the rest;
You were the only one
who understood
the futility of the
arrangement of life;
All the others were only
displeased with
trivial segments,
carped nonsensically
about nonsense;


Jane, you were killed
by knowing too much.
Here's a drink
to your bones
that this dog still
dreams about.


We are like roses
that have never bothered to bloom
when we should have bloomed
and it is as if the sun
has become disgusted with waiting.




The critics now have me
drinking champagne and
driving a BMW
and also married to a
socialite from
Philadelphia's Main Line
which of course is going to prevent me
from writing my earthy
and grubby stuff.
And they might be right,
I could be getting to be
more like them,
and that's as close to
death as you can get.
We'll see.
But don't bury me yet.
Don't worry
if I drink with Sean Penn.
Just measure the poems
as they come off the keyboard.
Listen only to them.
After this long fight
I have no intention of
quitting short.
Or late.
Or satisfied.


You haven't lived
until you've been in a
flophouse
with nothing but one
light bulb
and 56 men
squeezed together
on cots
with everybody
snoring at once
and some of those
snores so deep
and gross
and unbelievable -
dark
snotty
gross
subhuman
wheezing
from hell itself.
Your mind almost breaks
under those
death-like sounds
and the intermingling odors:
hard unwashed socks
pissed and shitted underwear
and over it all
slowly circulating air
much like that
emanating from
uncovered garbage cans.
And those bodies
in the dark fat
and thin and bent
some legless, armless,
some mindless
and worst of all:
the total absence of hope
it shrouds them
covers them totally.
It's not bearable.
You get up
go out
walk the streets
up and down
sidewalks
past buildings
around the corner
and back up
the same street
thinking those men
were all children once
what has happened to them?
And what has happened
to me?
It's dark
and cold
out here.


225 days under grass
and you know more than I.
They have long taken your blood,
you are a dry stick in a basket.
Is this how it works?
In this room
the hours of love
still make shadows.


When you left
you took almost everything.
I kneel in the nights
before tigers
that will not let me be.


What you were
will not happen again.
The tigers have found me
and I do not care.


Don't feel sorry for me.
I am a competent,
satisfied human being.


Be sorry for the others
who fidget complain,
who constantly rearrange their lives
like furniture.


Juggling mates and attitudes
their confusion is constant
and it will touch
whoever they deal with.


Beware of them:
One of their key words is "love."


And beware those
who only take instructions
from their God,
for they have failed completely
to live their own lives.


Don't feel sorry for me
because I am alone
for even at the most terrible moments
humor is my companion.


I am a dog walking backwards,
I am a broken banjo,
I am a telephone wire
strung up in Toledo, Ohio,
I am a man eating a meal
this night in the month of September.


Put your sympathy aside.
They say water held up Christ:
To come through
you better be nearly as lucky.


he drank wine all night of the
28th, and he kept thinking of her:
the way she walked and talked and loved
the way she told him things that seemed true
but were not, and he knew the color of each
of her dresses
and her shoes-he knew the stock and curve of
each heel
as well as the leg shaped by it.


and she was out again and when he came home,and
she'd come back with that special stink again,
and she did
she came in at 3 a.m in the morning
filthy like a dung eating swine
and
he took out a butchers knife
and she screamed
backing into the rooming house wall
still pretty somehow
in spite of love's reek
and he finished the glass of wine.


that yellow dress
his favorite
and she screamed again.


and he took up the knife
and unhooked his belt
and tore away the cloth before her
and cut off his balls.


and carried them in his hands
like apricots
and flushed them down the
toilet bowl
and she kept screaming
as the room became red


GOD O GOD!
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?


and he sat there holding 3 towels
between his legs
no caring now whether she left or
stayed
wore yellow or green or
anything at all.


and one hand holding and one hand
lifting he poured
another wine


I can remember starving in a
small room in a strange city
shades pulled down, listening to
classical music
I was young
I was so young it hurt
like a knife inside
because there was no alternative
except to hide as long as possible -
not in self-pity but with dismay
at my limited chance:
trying to connect.


the old composers — Mozart, Bach, Beethoven,
Brahms were the only ones who spoke to me and
they were dead.


finally, starved and beaten, I had to go into
the streets to be interviewed for low-paying and
monotonous
jobs
by strange men behind desks
men without eyes men without faces
who would take away my hours
break them
piss on them.


now I work for the editors
the readers the critics


but still hang around and drink with
Mozart, Bach, Brahms and the Bee
some buddies
some men
sometimes all we need
to be able to continue alone
are the dead
rattling the walls
that close us in.


sometimes you climb out of bed in the morning and you think,
I'm not going to make it, but you laugh inside
remembering all the times you've felt that way, and
you walk to the bathroom, do your toilet, see that face
in the mirror, oh my oh my oh my, but you comb your hair anyway,
get into your street clothes, feed the cats, fetch the
newspaper of horror, place it on the coffee table, kiss your
wife goodbye, and then you are backing the car out into life itself,
like millions of others you enter the arena once more.


you are on the freeway threading through traffic now,
moving both towards something and towards nothing at all as you punch
the radio on and get Mozart, which is something, and you will somehow
get through the slow days and the busy days and the dull
days and the hateful days and the rare days, all both so delightful
and so disappointing because
we are all so alike and so different.


you find the turn-off, drive through the most dangerous
part of town, feel momentarily wonderful as Mozart works
his way into your brain and slides down along your bones and
out through your shoes.


it's been a tough fight worth fighting
as we all drive along
betting on another day.


My grandmother had a serious gas
problem.
we only saw her on Sunday.
she'd sit down to dinner
and she'd have gas.
she was very heavy,
80 years old.
wore this large glass brooch,
that's what you noticed most
in addition to the gas.
she'd let it go just as food was being served.
she'd let it go in bursts
spaced about a minute apart.
she'd let it go
4 or 5 times
as we reached for the potatoes
poured the gravy
cut into the meat.


Nobody ever said anything,
especially me.
I was 6 years old.
only my grandmother spoke.
after 4 or 5 blasts
she would say in an offhand way,
"I'll bury you all!"


I didn't much like that:
first farting
then saying that.


It happened every Sunday.
she was my father's mother.


Every Sunday it was death and gas
and mashed potatoes and gravy
and that big glass brooch.


Those Sunday dinners would
always end with apple pie and
ice cream
and a big argument
about something or other,
my grandmother finally running out the door
and taking the red train back to
Pasadena
the place stinking for an hour
and my father walking about
fanning a newspaper in the air and
saying, "it's all that damned sauerkraut
she eats!"
